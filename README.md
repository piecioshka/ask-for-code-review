# ask-for-code-review

üß© Chrome extension that adds a button to GitHub Pull Requests to generate a code review request message with an issue link.

## How does it work? üöÄ

- Create a GitHub Pull Request with a title in the format: `JIRA_ID: My PR title`
  - Example: `JIRA-123: Fix the bug in the code`

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The extension extracts the issue ID from the PR title. You can use any format, but the issue ID must be present in the title.

- Open a GitHub Pull Request page.
- Note: On the same line as the PR title, you will see a button labeled <kbd>Ask for review</kbd>.
- Clicking it will generate a message containing the PR link, PR title, and issue link.

> [!TIP]
> The issue URL and message format can be configured in the extension settings.

- The message will be copied to the clipboard üìã.
- You can paste the message in a comment or chat to request a code review üéä.

Example _(with default configuration)_:

[![Button to the right of the title](./screenshots/demo.png)](https://github.com/openshift/openshift-docs/pull/95074)

Clicking the button above will copy the following message to the clipboard:

```
üôè Please review: https://github.com/openshift/openshift-docs/pull/95074 - OBSDOCS-1903: Add missing [.log_source] value and remove duplicate module [ [Issue](https://example.com/issue/OBSDOCS-1903) ]
```

> [!NOTE]
> The extension works only on open GitHub Pull Requests, not on Issues.
